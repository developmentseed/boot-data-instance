# Start up an EC2 or fargate instance 

This repo aims to start up a EC2 with all required applications for data processing or execute any docker container in Fargate. 

**Why was this repo created?**

There are projects where the data team needs to run data processing for large volumes, running locally can be a very painful and time-consuming process, that's the reason to use Fargate for processing large data sets or a EC2 with all application installed
